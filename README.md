## Description

#### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the HBNB README! 

This README serves as guide to understanding our HBNB.

HBNB is a specialized platform built to streamline the management of vacation rentals. Powered by a Python Flask backend API, it facilitates essential operations like user registration, property listing updates, booking management, and more.

So, let's dive in and explore our HBNB!

## OVERVIEW

HBNB is a comprehensive platform designed for efficiently managing vacation rentals. It features a robust backend API developed in Python using Flask, enabling seamless CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for users, property listings, and bookings. 

The HBnB Evolution project is crafted to guide you through the process of developing a web application from inception to deployment. You'll construct a comprehensive web application that includes:

- Architectural Design: Planning and structuring the application using Unified Modeling Language (UML).
- Testing and Validation: Developing comprehensive tests to validate the API and ensure the integrity of the business logic.
- API Implementation: Building the backend API using Flask, a versatile and powerful web framework.
- Data Storage Solutions: Implementing an initial file-based storage system to manage and store application data efficiently.
- Containerization with Docker: Packaging the application into Docker containers to facilitate easy deployment, scalability, and portability.

## Project Organization:

 - Interface Layer: This layer manages all incoming requests and formulates appropriate responses.
- Processing Layer: Here, the application processes and executes core operations, making critical decisions as needed.
- Storage Layer (persistence): Initially based on file storage, this layer oversees data management, ensuring secure and reliable storage.
